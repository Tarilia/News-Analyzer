### Description:
News-Analyzer is a classical machine learning model that can determine with high accuracy more than 90% whether the news is real (REAL) or FAKE (FAKE).

When developing the model, TfidfVectorizer was used to extract features from text data and PassiveAggressiveClassifier.


### Installation:
- download the project
- make install
- Register it in the file .env the PATH_TO_FILE variable, which specifies the path to the dataset

### Run:
- make run

### Visualization:
#### Let's analyze the data set and build a classic machine learning model that can determine with more than 90% accuracy whether the news is real or fake. Visualize the results and generate a report.

#### Downloading and analyzing the dataset
- looking through the first ten entries
